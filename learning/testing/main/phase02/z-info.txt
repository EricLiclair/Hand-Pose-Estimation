prediction, index = classifier.getPrediction(imgCrop)

The output [3.050329e-06, 0.99991703, 7.9864985e-05] represents the model's confidence scores for each class. 
The second element (index 1) in the list has the highest confidence, which means the model predicts that the input image belongs to the class with index 1.
