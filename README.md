# Hand-Pose-Estimation
This repository contains the code and resources to perform hand pose estimation using mediapipe. Hand pose estimation has a wide range of applications, from gesture recognition to human-computer interaction.
Hand pose estimation is the process of determining the 3D or 2D positions of a person's fingers and hand joints from an image or video. It is a crucial component in various applications, including sign language recognition, virtual reality, and augmented reality.
